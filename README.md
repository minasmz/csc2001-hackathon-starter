# 🌐 CSC2001 – Mini Hackathon: Final Web Integration Project

Welcome to your **final hands-on challenge** of the semester! 🎉  
You’ve learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API calls, and AJAX — now it’s time to put it all together in one fun, creative project.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Work in teams to build a **mini web application** that uses **real data from a public API**.  
Your app should be interactive, visually appealing, and showcase your teamwork and creativity.

---

## 👥 Team Setup
- Teams of **2–3 students**.  
- One student accepts the GitHub Classroom invite and **creates the team name** (e.g., *The Debuggers*).  
- Other members join the same team using the invite link.  
- Everyone will automatically have write access to the shared repository.

💬 *Tip:* Communicate and coordinate — decide who focuses on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but support each other throughout.
