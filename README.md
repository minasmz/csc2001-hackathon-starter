# 🌐 CSC2001 – Mini Hackathon: Final Web Integration Project

Welcome to your **final hands-on challenge** of the semester! 🎉  
You’ve learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API calls, and AJAX — now it’s time to put it all together in one fun, creative project.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Work in teams to build a **mini web application** that uses **real data from a public API**.  
Your app should be interactive, visually appealing, and showcase your teamwork and creativity.

---

## 👥 Team Setup
- Teams of **2–3 students**.  
- One student accepts the GitHub Classroom invite and **creates the team name** (e.g., *The Debuggers*).  
- Other members join the same team using the invite link.  
- Everyone will automatically have write access to the shared repository.

💬 *Tip:* Communicate and coordinate — decide who focuses on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, but support each other throughout.

Choose one of the following or come up with your own creative idea!

| Idea | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Quote Generator** | Fetch and display a random quote with a refresh button. |
| **Weather App** | Use an API to show current weather for a given city. |
| **Random User Card** | Display a random user profile from [randomuser.me/api](https://randomuser.me/api). |
| **Dictionary App** | Type a word and show its definition using a dictionary API. |
| **Fun Facts App** | Display random cat facts, dog images, or trivia. |
| **Mini Recipe Search** | Search recipes and show results from a public recipe API. |

## 🧠 Requirements

✅ **Must include:**
- At least **one API call** using `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`  
- Clean, semantic **HTML structure**  
- Some **CSS styling** (layout, colors, responsiveness encouraged)  
- **JavaScript interactivity** (button click, user input, etc.)  
- **Displayed API data** rendered dynamically on the web page  

⭐ **Bonus for:**
- Using multiple APIs  
- Adding animations or transitions  
- Handling errors gracefully (`if (xhr.status === 200)` or `.catch(error)`)  
- Creative design, humor, or storytelling

## 🚀 View Your Website Live (GitHub Pages)
Once your `index.html` is ready:
1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.  
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set:
   - **Source:** “Deploy from branch”
   - **Branch:** “main” → “/(root)”
3. Click **Save** and wait 1–2 minutes.  
4. Your live site will appear at  https://<org>.github.io/<repo-name>/
5. 5. Share that link for your final demo.

## 🏁 Deliverables
At the end of the hackathon:
- ✅ Working web app with HTML + CSS + JS + API
